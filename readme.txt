"Tilted Twitter Cloud Widget" is a free plugin for Wordpress, developed by the Whiletrue.it staff to generate a tag cloud with the most used words in the last 100 tweets from a public Twitter account.

The words inside the cloud are overlapping and tilted, creating a cluster. 

The following options are customizable:
* number of words shown
* link every word to a global Twitter search
* link every word to a Twitter search inside the user's profile

This plugin displays the latest posts from a Twitter account in a sidebar widget.
